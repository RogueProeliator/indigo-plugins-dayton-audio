# Introduction
This Indigo plugin allows Indigo to control the DAX66 6-Source/6-Zone Distributed Audio System from [Dayton Audio](http://www.daytonaudio.com/). Thanks to a robust protocol, this plugin is able to both read and set nearly every aspect of the receiver such as zone power, volume, treble, bass, and more.
