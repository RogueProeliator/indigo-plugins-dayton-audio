# Introduction
This Indigo plugin allows Indigo to control the DAX66 6-Source/6-Zone Distributed Audio System from [Dayton Audio](http://www.daytonaudio.com/). Thanks to a robust protocol, this plugin is able to both read and set nearly every aspect of the receiver such as zone power, volume, treble, bass, and more. The latest update requires Indigo 2022.2 or above; however previous versions are available for previous release below.
